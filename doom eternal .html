    <p>Doom Eternal is a first-person shooter game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. The sequel to Doom (2016), and the sixth main game in the Doom series, it was released on March 20, 2020, for Windows, PlayStation 4, Stadia and Xbox One, with a version for Nintendo Switch being released on December 8, 2020, and versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S being released on June 29, 2021. Set some time after the events of the 2016 game, the story follows the Doomslayer once again, on a mission to end Hell's consumption of Earth and foil the alien Maykr's plans to exterminate humanity.</p>
<p>Along with the single-player campaign, a multiplayer mode, Battlemode, was in00troduced. In this mode, players can either play as the Doom Slayer or as a demon, and fight until either the Doom Slayer defeats the demons, or vice versa. Another mode, Horde mode, was added in October 2021. The Ancient Gods, a two-part standalone campaign DLC set after the events of the main game, was released between October 2020 and March 2021</p>
<P>Doom Eternal was released to a positive critical response, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack, and combat mechanics, though some disliked the increased focus on storytelling and its platforming sections. Doom Eternal received five nominations at The Game Awards for 2020, including Game of the Year and Best Action Game.</P></div>

    <div class="about">
        <p>Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer who battles the demonic forces of Hell, from a first-person perspective. The game continues its predecessor's emphasis on "push-forward" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, Chaingun, BFG 9000, Ballista, and the Unmaykr. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the "Crucible Blade" energy sword, the Sentinel Argent Hammer, and a retractable arm-blade called the "Doomblade" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent "glory kill" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the "Meat Hook", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a grappling hook, useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. In addition, there is the Flame Belch, a flamethrower that sets enemies on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.[1] New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.</p>
