    <p>Roblox (/ˈroʊblɒks/) is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<P>Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all American children under 16.[9][10] Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation, microtransactions, and exploitative practices directed toward children.</P></div>

    <div class="about">
        <p>Roblox allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio, which can then be played by other users.[11] Games (called "experiences" by the corporation) are made with an object-oriented & open-source programming language based on Lua, known as Luau.[12][13] Users are able to create purchasable content through one-time purchases, known as "game passes", as well as microtransactions which can be purchased more than once, known as "developer products" or "products".[14][15] The majority of games produced using Roblox Studio are developed by minors, and a total of 20 million games a year are produced using it.</p>
